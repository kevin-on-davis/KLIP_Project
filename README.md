**Bookshelf**

Built to help the user discover their next great read. Bookshelf allows the user to search a desired author, title or genre and provides results based on the input criterion. Upon selection of a title, the user is redirected to a page with information pertaining to the book and recommendations of similar books. The user is given the option to add the book to their personal bookshelf where they can save their reading list for later or find the most accessible way to purchase the book or borrow the book from the nearest library. Bookshelf's responsive design allows the user to easily utilize across a diverse range of devices.

Bookshelf is accessible at, https://kevin-on-davis.github.io/KLIP_Project/. The link will direct the user to Bookshelf's landing page and display as seen below.

A new page is displayed containing a synopsis, reviews and recommendations (GoodReads API). User clicks button “add to bookshelf”. User is given the option to click the "borrow" button, "buy" button or "delete" button. If the user clicks "buy", the user is directed to a price list generated from Google Books API. If the user clicks borrow, the user is directed to a map (Mapbox API) with a shapefile of public library locations nearest them (OpenLibrary API).
